# for loop are used when you have a block of code which you can want to repeat a fixed number of times

# foods=['dosa','poori','momo','mango']

# for i in foods[1:]:
#     print(i)

# range(start,stop,step)->number of sequence
# start by default zero
# stop(excluded)
# step(by default 1)


# for i in range(11):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(2,11,2):
#     print(i)
# for i in range(len(foods)):
#     print(foods[i],'-',i)

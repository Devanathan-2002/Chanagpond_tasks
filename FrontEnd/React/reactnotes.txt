react:

it is javascript library
it is use to create rich user interface
it create single page application(spa).


technology prerequists:

html,css,js(basic js,ES5 and ES6,oops);

software:
--node js
commanand tho check node js version:
node -v
npm -v

--vs code editor


how to create react project
there are three ways to create react project
-- by using npm: need to install configuration file.
    -- npm install -g create-react-app.
    -- create-react-app appname.
    -- cd appname
    -- npm start

-- by using npx: no need to install configuration file
    -- npx create-react-app appname.
    -- cd appname
    -- npm start

-- by using vite: it creates minimun package.

how to start react project:
npm start


react folder structure:
all the depandicies and dev-dependencies will install in this
-- package.json:all dependencies entry will found.
--package-lock.json: detail description of file you will found here.
--readme,md it is guid file how to use react project.
--public: it will contain static data in it.

react is component basics technology:

compnent: it is partial part of react project.

in react app.js is root component.

-in ecah we have two types of component,

function component: when your main focus is on ui dessign.
class component: when you have to implement complex logic in that caase we use it

how to display compnent output.

JSX(javascript+xml):
it allows us to write html code in react.

it makes ract code eassy in jsx we have wrape multiple element inside ine parent element.

parent element must be any block elemt like div,h1-h6,p etc..


props: 
--it is parmeter or fnctional parameter which is use pass data inside component.
--props return data in object formate.
-- wer can accesss props in function component by wtriting props.propsname.
--we can access props in class componenet by witiong this.props.propsName.

state:

--it is use to handel essential in class component.
--it return us object type of data.
--in class component we write state inside constructor.
--if you want use state in function component for that we use useState Hook

how to use bootstrap in react:

--npm i bootstrap
-- go to index.js file and import its path
-- use bootstrap classes
path:bootstrap/dist/css/


conditional rendering:
--display componnet on the basics conditional
-- use of if else: if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block
-- element as variable: in variable we stotre data and display inside tag and retuen it
-- use of ternary operator: short hand syntasx for if else

how to use css in react:
there are three ways to0 use css:
internal css:
external css:
module css:

frangment in react:
--it is an alternative oprnion for jsx.
-- it remove unwated element from DOM herirachy.

parentComp (cc): state empName,empsal display it output write method to manipulate state property.


component interaction:
-- accessing data from parent component to child component.
-- while performing component interaction in between component they must have parent child relation.
-- how to establish parent child relation in between component, first we have to import child.
-- component in parent component and then write child component name as tag in parent component.

_pure component_:

--it is use to prevent un-nessary re-rendering class component by performing shallow comparision.
- to achive this we have extends class component with pure component class.

_react.Memo()_:

-it is use to prevent un-nessary re-rendering function component by performing shallow comparison.
-- to achive we have to apss function component name as argument to react.memo() method.


_hod_(higher oreder component):
-- when we have to share same buissness logic with multiple component in that case we use it.
-- in this we share buissness logic from function component to class or function component.

__Error boundary_:

-- it is react component which is use to handel error occur in component three while rendering component.
-- to handle it we use two class component life-cycle method.
1, getDerivedStateFormError(): when error occur in component it execute automatically.
2, componentDidCatch(): it will display error log(error imformation).

_virtual DOM_:
--Instead of manupulating the virtual dom randomly the rect cretates virtual dom in its memory, where its all the nessary changes in memory before making change in broweser dom.
-- react render the code needs to be change only.

_routing in react_:

--navigation in react.
-- by wruting routing path name in browser url to dispaly component output or view.
-- we use react-router-dom library in react to perfrom routing.


_router_:
-- https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/v6

1, createBrowserDom(): it is a method which taskes array of type of data.
                        -in its object we use two property path and element.
                        - in this mehtod we define all types of routing.
2, RouterProvider(): it helps us to render output of all routing component on browser.


src folder:
  -- mainRouting folder:
        routing.js file
--- layout folder:
    LoginComp
    FooterComp
    MainDashBordComp
    PageNotFoundComp

_types of routing_:

1, naming routing: display component after writing component routing path name in browser.
2, default routing: display component output without routing path name.
3, parameterized routing: display componenet output after passing parameter with routhing path name.
4, child routing: display one routing inside another routing.
                -- to perform child routing we use children property in object which array of object value.
                -- to display child routing output we have to add <outlet> library in parent routing component.
5, wild card routing.when user write wrong path name in browser url then we decide what component output should displlay.

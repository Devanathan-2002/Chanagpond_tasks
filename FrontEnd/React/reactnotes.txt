react:

it is javascript library
it is use to create rich user interface
it create single page application(spa).


technology prerequists:

html,css,js(basic js,ES5 and ES6,oops);

software:
--node js
commanand tho check node js version:
node -v
npm -v

--vs code editor


how to create react project
there are three ways to create react project
-- by using npm: need to install configuration file.
    -- npm install -g create-react-app.
    -- create-react-app appname.
    -- cd appname
    -- npm start

-- by using npx: no need to install configuration file
    -- npx create-react-app appname.
    -- cd appname
    -- npm start

-- by using vite: it creates minimun package.

how to start react project:
npm start


react folder structure:
all the depandicies and dev-dependencies will install in this
-- package.json:all dependencies entry will found.
--package-lock.json: detail description of file you will found here.
--readme,md it is guid file how to use react project.
--public: it will contain static data in it.

react is component basics technology:

compnent: it is partial part of react project.

in react app.js is root component.

-in ecah we have two types of component,

function component: when your main focus is on ui dessign.
class component: when you have to implement complex logic in that caase we use it

how to display compnent output.

JSX(javascript+xml):
it allows us to write html code in react.

it makes ract code eassy in jsx we have wrape multiple element inside ine parent element.

parent element must be any block elemt like div,h1-h6,p etc..


props: 
--it is parmeter or fnctional parameter which is use pass data inside component.
--props return data in object formate.
-- wer can accesss props in function component by wtriting props.propsname.
--we can access props in class componenet by witiong this.props.propsName.

state:

--it is use to handel essential in class component.
--it return us object type of data.
--in class component we write state inside constructor.
--if you want use state in function component for that we use useState Hook

how to use bootstrap in react:

--npm i bootstrap
-- go to index.js file and import its path
-- use bootstrap classes
path:bootstrap/dist/css/


conditional rendering:
--display componnet on the basics conditional
-- use of if else: if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block
-- element as variable: in variable we stotre data and display inside tag and retuen it
-- use of ternary operator: short hand syntasx for if else

how to use css in react:
there are three ways to0 use css:
internal css:
external css:
module css:

frangment in react:
--it is an alternative oprnion for jsx.
-- it remove unwated element from DOM herirachy.

parentComp (cc): state empName,empsal display it output write method to manipulate state property.


component interaction:
-- accessing data from parent component to child component.
-- while performing component interaction in between component they must have parent child relation.
-- how to establish parent child relation in between component, first we have to import child.
-- component in parent component and then write child component name as tag in parent component.

_pure component_:

--it is use to prevent un-nessary re-rendering class component by performing shallow comparision.
- to achive this we have extends class component with pure component class.

_react.Memo()_:

-it is use to prevent un-nessary re-rendering function component by performing shallow comparison.
-- to achive we have to apss function component name as argument to react.memo() method.


_hod_(higher oreder component):
-- when we have to share same buissness logic with multiple component in that case we use it.
-- in this we share buissness logic from function component to class or function component.

__Error boundary_:

-- it is react component which is use to handel error occur in component three while rendering component.
-- to handle it we use two class component life-cycle method.
1, getDerivedStateFormError(): when error occur in component it execute automatically.
2, componentDidCatch(): it will display error log(error imformation).

_virtual DOM_:
--Instead of manupulating the virtual dom randomly the rect cretates virtual dom in its memory, where its all the nessary changes in memory before making change in broweser dom.
-- react render the code needs to be change only.

_routing in react_:

--navigation in react.
-- by wruting routing path name in browser url to dispaly component output or view.
-- we use react-router-dom library in react to perfrom routing.


_router_:
-- https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/v6

1, createBrowserDom(): it is a method which taskes array of type of data.
                        -in its object we use two property path and element.
                        - in this mehtod we define all types of routing.
2, RouterProvider(): it helps us to render output of all routing component on browser.


src folder:
  -- mainRouting folder:
        routing.js file
--- layout folder:
    LoginComp
    FooterComp
    MainDashBordComp
    PageNotFoundComp

_types of routing_:

1, naming routing: display component after writing component routing path name in browser.
2, default routing: display component output without routing path name.
3, parameterized routing: display componenet output after passing parameter with routhing path name.
4, child routing: display one routing inside another routing.
                -- to perform child routing we use children property in object which array of object value.
                -- to display child routing output we have to add <outlet> library in parent routing component.
5, wild card routing.when user write wrong path name in browser url then we decide what component output should displlay.


how to create layout for reactProject:

Class component life cycle method:
-it comes with four phases.
1, mounting phase:
    -- constructor: when class object initialize constructor get execute automatically.
    -- getDerivedStateFromProps: it is static methodwhich execute automatically and it is use to set value coming form props to state.
    -- render: it is respoansible to render component data.
    -- componentDidMount: it will execute immidiatly after render method.

2, update phase: when Dom manipulation is done.
    --shouldComponentUpdate: it decide wether component will update or not.
                            - it return boolean value, if true then componet will update.
    -- getSnapShotBeforeUpdate:it return previous data of props and state defore updation of it.
    -- render: it is reponsible to render component data.
    -- compnentWillUpdate: it will return updated
3.unmounting phases : when Componentis deleted
    ==> componentWillMount--it just call before component deleted,it is use to disconnect component 
                            connection other component.
 
4.Error phase : 
    ==> getDerivedStateFromError()-- it execute automatically when error occure in Components 
    ==> componentDidCatch()--it return error log

REACT REDUCT EXTENSION :
--rfce -- Create normal Function component
--rafce -- create arrow function component
--rce -- create class component
--rconst -- it create constructor with super method and  state.

HOOKS IN REACT:
--it allows us to use class component feature in function component
--by using hooks we can use  state in function component
--in react hooks introduce in react version-16

RULES TO USE REACT:
--hooks work only in function component
--hooks always use in top-level component
--hooks can not be render conditionaly

1.useState Hook:
2.useEffect Hook:
3.useContext Hook:
4.useRef Hook:
5.useReducer Hook:
6.useCallback hooks:
7.useMemo hooks:


useState hook:
-- if you want to use state in function component for that yoou have to use usestate hook
-- it return two values, 1==Currentstate 2==function-to-update-statedata
-- before using it import it first from react library.
syntax: const[currentState,functionToUpdateState]=useState(Value);


useState Hook: it will execute after component render data.
-- it will handel work of componentDid Mount,componnetDidUpdate,componentWillMount in function.
-- it takes two values 1, callback function, 2, dependencies.
syntax: useEffect(()=>{},dependencies)

React/Reduct extension:
- rfce:create normal function component.
- rafce: create arrow function component.
-- rce: create class component.
-- rconst: it create constructor with super method and state.


case1: when no dependencies values
        -- use effect will execute after every render.
case 2: when we pass dependencies value as blank array
        -- use Effect hook will execute only once.
        syntax: useEffect(()=>{},[])
case-3: when we have to execute useEffect hook as we want.
        -- we pass value in dependencies.
        syntax: useEffect(()=>{},dependencies).

CRUD:
-- rest Fake API:
_Axios Library_: it is use to make request from react app.

how to install axios:
npm i axios

_json server_: it is dummy server. it provides server environment to database.
npm install json-server

_json database_:


how to start and json upload db.json
cd scr/shared/database/(press enter) 
json-server --watch -p 8888 db._json

src folder:
    CRUD folder
        -- ProductDashComp
        -- ProductAddComp
        -- ProductEditComp

get request: to fetch data form server.

material ui:

--it provides inbuild component whuch makes reeact project attractive
-- as we as it provide icon.
-- its official website is www.mui.com

____________------------__________-------------_________________-----------------____________________

_npm use concurrently_;

how to install react botstrap:
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

mui: it provide inbuilt component

to create build file

--npm run build

serve -s build


*What is testing in React
---------------------------
S/W pre-required
-nodejs=> node --version
-git=> git --version



-With react two comes for testing;
1.reaact-testing:it is use to execute or run test program
2.jest:it is test runner or it provide platform to run testcase

*How to create testing component:
componentName.test.js

TDD(Test Driven Development):it is software testing process,in which developer write test case before development.

*To perform testing in react need to write
npm run test

test("msg",function):
-it is method which is use to perform unit testing.
-it takes two parameter
       1.message:in this message developer write what he is going to perform in short.
       2.function:in function write testing code.


10/12/24:

--describe(msg,function): it is use to group multiple test case.
--coverage: it is tracking process it will tell us how much cod cover.

how to generate test coverage file
step:1--go to package.json and write in script tag
scripts:{
    "coverage":"just --coverage --watchAll"
}

step:2--in pacakage.json file and jest coverage code

"jest":{
    "collectCoverage":true,
    "coverageDirectory":"coverage",
    "coverageReporters":["json","lcov","text","clover"],
    "coverageThreshold":{
      "global":{
        "branches":80,
        "functions":80,
        "lines":80,
        "statements":80
      }
    }
  }


  Redux: it use to store,manage and tract state for javascript application.
  or it is predictable state contianer for java script.

  --redux work o three core primciple.

  --store(bank)-- it is use to store state in it.
  --action-- (window,deposit,transfer): it is simple statement which are going to perform.
  --reducer(casier): it acctually carryout state transaction depending om staate and action and it retun new state.


react project:
redux library:
    --reduxtoolkit

react-redux library: it is use to connect react app with redux or redux toolkit.

_______________________------------_________________________---------------____________
Angular:

--it is java script framework
-- it provide desigining and developemnet paltform for creating single page application.
-- latestversion of angular is 18.
-- angular is developed and maintained by google.

** commands to install and work with angular **

ng --version

npm install -g @angular/cli

ng new projectname

ng serve to start project

-- angular work on component-- 
compnent: it is partial part of angular project 
            --it coantins code for angular project,
            --it can be used any part of project, which we can reuse multiple time.

-- in angular root componnet name is app

** how to create component in Angular **

ng generate component componentName
ng g c component name


-- when we create component in angular it generate four file html,css,ts,spec.ts
-- how to get output of individual component.
-- go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want.

** data binding**
-- getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
1. interpolation {{}}: in send data from ts file to html file.
2. property binding[]: in this we set attribute (property) values ts=> html.
3. event binding (): in this we sent data from html => ts file
4. two-way databinding [()]= in this we can send data from ts to html
                            -- to perfrom two-way databinding we have ng model directory but ngmodel directive is not part of core angular module it is part formsmodule, for this first we have to import form module in app.ts file import array.ts file in import array.

**directive in angular**
-- it is use to change apperance and behaviour as well as perform dom manipulation in angular
-- there are three types of directives in angular.
1. structural directives: it is use to perform dom manipulation in angular.
                            -- structural directive denoted by *
                            -- structural directive are *ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase.
                            -- we can apply one directive at a time to single element.
                            -- it is part of common module for this first we have to import comman in component.

ng-template -- display out on the basis of condition
                         -- to create reference variable in angular we use #
                
    2. attribute directive --it is use to cahnge appearance and behaviour of DOM
                  -ngStyle-- it is used to apply css style property on the basic of condition
                  -ngClass-- it is used to apply css class on the basis of condition
                  -ngModel-- it is use to perform two-way binding

3. custom derective:
 ng g directive directiivename

 ng g c parent
 ng g c child

 comaponent interaction:
 accesing data from parent component to child component
 -- input() decerator : it is use to send data from parent component to child component.
 --output() decerator: it is use to send data from child component to parent component.

 pipes*:
 --it is use to transform property value without changing itd original value.
 -- it is denoted by | single
 -- there are three types of pipes in angular.
 1. inbuilt: pipe provided by angular.
 2. custom pipe: pipe create by developer for particular use.
 3. thirdparty pipe : pipes already developed by third party vender, first we have to install it and then use it.



custom pipes:

how to install bootstrap in angular

-- npm i bootstrap
-- got to angular.json and in its style array import its paths
-- restart angular project.

layout folder:

nav,pagenot found,maindashboard,footer,LoginComp
ng g c layout/nav
form folder,
angform,utdf,utf

*routing in angular:
-- navigation of component.
-- to display component output or navigating component by using routing in anguar for it we write code in app.routes.ts file.
-- in angular all routing component wil display its output bellow <router-outer>


1. naming routing:
2. default routing:
3. redirect routing:
4. parameterized routing:
5. child routing:
6. wild-card routing:

_____________------------------------------------------------------------------------_________________
12/12/24

How to navigate in angular:
--to perform component navigating we have to use routerlink property with anchor tag, but first we have to import routerlink in component ts file form "@react/router" library.


angular form:
-- there are two types of forms.
1. UTDF( user Template Driven Form)
    -- when we have create simple form validation in that case we use it.
    -- to perform validation we have to use ng model directory with input element.
    -- in this ngForm directory will hold data all element in it.
2. Rtf (reactive template form):
    -- when we have to write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use it.
    -- to use rtf form validation first we have to import ReactiveFormModule from FormsModule in component.
    -- in rtf we write form validation code in ts file.
    -- in this we use mainly two classes, formGroup, formControl.
    -- formGroup: it will hold information of all input element.
    -- formControl: it will hold information of individual input element.


how to create service class:
    ng g service service name
    ng g service shared/services/service name

services in angular:
- in angular services is speical class with extra power.
- it is use for multiple users
1. to share data with multiple component.
2. we can implement buissness logoc in it.
3. we can perform external communication.

* how to access data from service into angular component.
-- if you want to service data into angular for this first we have import service in componnet ts file and create instance of service class


REST Fake API
--CRUD
cd src/app/shared/database (enter)
json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json

how to make api reaquest from angular to services
-- to send requests from angular service to server for this we have create instance of HTTPclient class in service constructor, but HttpClient class in not part of HttpClientModule, so first we have to imort HttpClientModule module. so first we have to import provideHttpClient as well as withJsonSupport in app. config.ts file and make entry of these library in provider array.

so we have to import HttpClientModule.

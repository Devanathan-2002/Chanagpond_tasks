javascript

-it is use to add functionality into web app.
-it is interpreted language
-it is loosely typed language

why java script is loosley type language?
    when we create a variable in js it cannot determained what type of data it contain until and unless initialize it. 
    in js variable we can stotre multiple type of value in it.

how to use javascript?

 there are two ways to use java script
 -- internal javascript: in html file we can use script tag and in that we write js code.

 -- external javascript: in this we create a seperate js file and import that js file in the html.


 how to get output in js
 1, document.write(): it will display output in html page. it will display output in same line.
 2, window.alert(): it will display output in modal group window.
 3, console.log(): it will display output in browser console or in internal.
 4, innerHTML(DOM): it will display output inside an element.

hoisting:

moving varibale and function decleration at the top of the webpage.

variable: it is use to store data in it.
- we can create in js by using var, let, const

1,  var: it create function scope variable.
    we can use variable before its decleration
    we can redeclare variable.

2, let: --it create block scope variable.
        --we can not use variable befroe its decleration.
        --we can not redeclare variable.

3, const : it create block scope variable.
        -- we can not use variable before its declerataion.
        -- in this when we declare a variable at same time we have to initilaize it.
        -- its data will never change on run time.

--exponention(**) it return powewr of any number

==(equals to): 
-- it will check value only and if both are same the it return true value.

===(exactly equals to):
-- it will check value as well as its datatype and if both are same it will return true value.


dom manipulation:

function: it is block of code which is use to perform specific task.
            - function will execute only when we call it.

there are mainly two types of function:

1, predefine function: provide js to us.
2, userdefine: user developed for particular use.

syntax: 

function functionName(){
    //logical code
}

functionName();

how to change attribute value by using dom
how to call function by using event
how to access data from input control


array:
--it is use to store multiple values with same data type.
--in aarry data store on index basics.
--array index always start from zero index.
-- we can access array values outside by wrirting arrayname[indexnumber]


object:

it is use to store multiple values with different data types.
--in object data store in key and value paired formate.
-- we can access object data outside of by writting object.keyName.
-- object type of data in denoted by {}

callback function:: passing a function name as a argument inside another inside another function is called callback function.

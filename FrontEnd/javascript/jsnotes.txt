javascript

-it is use to add functionality into web app.
-it is interpreted language
-it is loosely typed language

why java script is loosley type language?
    when we create a variable in js it cannot determained what type of data it contain until and unless initialize it. 
    in js variable we can stotre multiple type of value in it.

how to use javascript?

 there are two ways to use java script
 -- internal javascript: in html file we can use script tag and in that we write js code.

 -- external javascript: in this we create a seperate js file and import that js file in the html.


 how to get output in js
 1, document.write(): it will display output in html page. it will display output in same line.
 2, window.alert(): it will display output in modal group window.
 3, console.log(): it will display output in browser console or in internal.
 4, innerHTML(DOM): it will display output inside an element.

oops:
--class: it is collection of data memeber and member function.
-- it is template which we can re use.
-- to create class we use class keyword.

this: it refers to the current class or object to access its data inside it only.

2, object:

--it is an instace of class.
--it allow us to access class data member and member fuction outside class.

syntax: let objectName=new ClassName();

constructor:
-- it is special member function of class.
-- it will executes autimatically when class object is created or initialized.
-- in typescript constructor name must be only connstructor.

Inheritance:
-- accessing parent class property into child class.
- to perform inheritance in between classes we use extends keyword.


super():
-- it represents parent calss constructor inside child class constructor.
-- super method must be first statement in child class constructor.

encapsulation:
--warpping of data inot single unit.

--public: we can access class property inside,outside class as well as in derived class.
-- protected: we can access class property inside same class as well as derived class.
--private: we can access class prperty inside same class only.



polymorpism:

it is ability to take more than one form.
--method overloading:
-- when we have multiple method with same name in class.
-- when we have multiple method with same name in different class.

abstraction:

--hiding implementation and showing necessary information.
-- we can achive this by uisng interface,abstract class.


module:
wwiting ts code in sigle and multiple file reuse or access it in another file
-- to achive this we use export and import keywords.
-- to send data we use export keyword.
-- to  access it we use import.

 *interface:
 -it is signature of class.
 -it contain abstract method.
 -to create interface we use interface keyword.
 -its child cls has responsibility to implemnt it.
 -to implement we use implements keyword.
